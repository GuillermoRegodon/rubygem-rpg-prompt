|  Example of use the RPG Combat Assistant, by Guillermo Regodón.
|  
|  First, we should create a character for each player. For example:
|  
|  >>>cc billy
|  
|  to create a Character for player billy. Answer the questionnaire. Each character
|  has a {short_name} to handle it, billy in this case. Then it has a full name, an
|  optional nickname, a race, health points, a weapon, an armor, and a movement
|  capacity. In these simple rules, the race, the weapon and the movement capacity
|  have no effect in the game. Let us say that we create Billy the warrior, a human
|  who uses a broad sword and plate armor.
|  
|  Full name => Billy
|  Nickname => the warrior
|  Race => Human
|  Health Points => 10
|  Weapon => broad sword
|  Armor => plate
|  Movement Capacity => 10
|  
|  Then we create an enemy, Azog the white goblin, an orc who uses a mace and hardened
|  leather armor. He has 8 health points and a movement capacity 10.
|  
|  >>>cf azog
|  
|  In the pool we have 2 warriors so far.
|  
|  >>>pool
|  billy: Billy the Warrior
|  azog: Azog the white goblin
|  
|  You may just type "p" instead of "pool". Similarly you could have typed "createchar"
|  and "createfoe" instead of "cc" and "cf". Let the warriors join the combat. type
|  "save w billy" ("sw billy") and "save w azog" ("sw azog") to save them in files.
|  
|  >>>join billy
|  >>>join azog
|  >>>combatstatus
|  billy: Billy the Warrior: 10 hp
|  azog: Azog the white goblin: 8 hp
|  
|  Or just "s" to get the status of the combat, with the health points prompted. Then
|  combat starts with an attack from Billy the Warrior to Azog the white goblin.
|  
|  >>>billy hits azog
|  ¡Billy the Warrior attacks Azog the white goblin!
|  Press 'r' to enter a roll or any other key for a random roll.
|  
|  You may enter the roll in you prefer to roll real dice instead of getting random
|  numbers from an unknown algorithm. Let us trust the random number generator to be
|  a fair judge of the warriors destiny.
|  
|  >>>billy hits azog
|  ¡Billy the Warrior attacks Azog the white goblin!
|  Press 'r' to enter a roll or any other key for a random roll.
|  Dice rolling... ¡5!
|  The attack succeeds!
|  Press 'r' to enter a roll or any other key for a random roll.
|  
|  The attack succeeding, a new roll is needed to get the damage.
|  
|  >>>billy hits azog
|  ¡Billy the Warrior attacks Azog the white goblin!
|  Press 'r' to enter a roll or any other key for a random roll.
|  Dice rolling... ¡5!
|  The attack succeeds!
|  Press 'r' to enter a roll or any other key for a random roll.
|  Dice rolling... ¡2!
|  ¡Azog the white goblin loses 2 hp!
|  
|  A call to "combatstatus" prompts
|  
|  >>>s
|  billy: Billy the Warrior: 10 hp
|  azog: Azog the white goblin: 6 hp
|  
|  Let the cries of pain from azog attract his hench-orcs. We have to create them
|  before. As a generic type of enemy, it has to be created as a Spawn template.
|  The difference is that it may have many possible names and nicknames.
|  
|  >>>createspawn orc
|  Enter names for this kind of enemy, recomended 10 or more,
|    "q" to finish. Enter only the race if it is an enemy without name.
|  Ulag
|  Urglu
|  Shagrath
|  Gorbagh
|  Karg
|  Zulburg
|  Groggash
|  Skumzag
|  Agash
|  Zudak
|  q
|  Enter nicknames for this kind of enemy, recomended 10 or more,
|    "q" to finish.
|  the Smelly
|  the Dumb
|  the Cruel
|  the Elfslayer
|  the Destroyer
|  the Crazy Lamb
|  the Poisson Razer
|  the Gross
|  the Fearless
|  the Hunchback
|  q
|  
|  "cs orc" could have been used. They are Orcs, have 5 health points, use
|  scimitars and hardened leather, and they may move up to 10 meters per assault.
|  They join the combat by typing
|  
|  >>>spawn orc x3
|  Spawning enemies: 3 of type orc
|  
|  >>>s
|  billy: Billy the Warrior: 10 hp
|  azog: Azog the white goblin: 6 hp
|  orc1: Karg the Hunchback: 5 hp
|  orc2: Skumzag the Cruel: 5 hp
|  orc3: Zulburg the Poisson Razer: 5 hp
|  
|  They may bring wolfs as well, the only difference is that they would not have
|  names, and we woould type "Wolf" for the full name. They may have nicknames,
|  like "alfa", "old", "defiant" or "black". Billy is in trouble, which was
|  expected when he was entering an orc cave alone, he should have brought allies,
|  like Edana the shadow queen. The warriors leave the combat when they die, or when
|  "leave billy" is typed.
|  
|  For the next game we could prepare scenes. Let us prepare an orc_hall and a
|  wolf_cave. Type "lw" to list the available warriors in saved files, and
|  "free all" to start a pool and a combat from scratch.
|  
|  >>>free all
|  >>>lw
|  wolf
|  billy
|  orc
|  edana
|  azog
|  
|  Let us create the "orc_hall" scene.
|  
|  >>>lw azog
|  >>>lw orc
|  
|  >>>join azog
|  >>>spawn orc x3
|  
|  >>>s
|  azog: Azog the white goblin: 10 hp
|  orc1: Agash the Gross: 5 hp
|  orc2: Ulag the Cruel: 5 hp
|  orc3: Gorbagh the Smelly: 5 hp
|  
|  >>>save s orc_hall
|  Saving...
|  Scene saved.
|  
|  Similarly, the "wolf_cave" scene.
|  
|  >>>spawn wolf x5
|  Spawning enemies: 5 of type wolf
|  
|  >>>s
|  wolf1: Wolf old: 6 hp
|  wolf2: Wolf beta: 6 hp
|  wolf3: Wolf grey: 6 hp
|  wolf4: Wolf alfa: 6 hp
|  wolf5: Wolf scarred: 6 hp
|  
|  >>>ss wolf_cave
|  Saving...
|  Scene saved.
|  
|  We have use "ss" as a short version of "save s". Let us list the save scenes
|  
|  >>>ls
|  orc_hall
|  wolf_cave
|  
|  The command "load scene orc_hall" or "ls orc_hall" loads azog and the orc
|  template into the pool, and Azog the white goblin, Agash the Gross, Ulag
|  the Cruel and Gorbagh the Smelly into the combat.
|  
|  You make quit and save the temporal pool and combat using "quit -s" or
|  dismiss them with "quit -q".
